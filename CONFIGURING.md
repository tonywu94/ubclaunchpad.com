# Configuring

> ⚠️ This page is meant to be read from the [Configuring the UBC Launch Pad Website](https://ubclaunchpad.github.io/new/config) documentation site.

Most site value configurations (recruitment status, teams, etc.) can be updated by changing the values in [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/src/config.ts).

To make an edit, simply edit the values in `config.ts` based on the guidance in the type documentation in this website and open a pull request.

If something you want to change cannot be updated with `config.ts`, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed contribution guidance.
